# Webscraping_Automotive_Ecommerce

The used vehicle market in Peru has grown a lot after the pandemic caused by covid-19, resulting in an interesting segment to start a business. The objective of this project was to obtain information on this segment, such as market prices, number of vehicles for sale, vehicle characteristics, age, equipment, and others. This was possible with the help of web scraping techniques, python and the Beautiful Soap library.
